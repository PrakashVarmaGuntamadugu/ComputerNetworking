Procedure:
1. Create a C-based server that can runs on cse01.cse.unt.edu and accepts single client’s request on using sockets
2. Create a C-based client that runs on cse02.cse.unt.edu and connects to the server
3. On the client side, create a TCP segment as shown in Figure 1. Create a C structure with the following fields
a. 16-bit source and destination port [Type: unsigned short int]
b. 32-bit sequence number [Type: unsigned int]
c. 32-bit acknowledgement number [Type: unsigned int]
d. 4-bit data offset or header length (in multiples of 32-bit)
e. 6-bit reserved section

iii. Compute the 16-bit
