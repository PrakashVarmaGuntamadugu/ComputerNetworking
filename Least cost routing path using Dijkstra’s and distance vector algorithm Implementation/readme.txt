Objective:

To find the least cost routing path using Dijkstra’s and distance vector algorithm

Procedure :


Compile the program using below command

gcc -Wall -o route route.c  route.h


run the command using below command.

./route


In zip file,

route.h is header file used in main program

route.c is the program

DV.txt represents output using Dijkstra’s algorithm.

LS.txt represents outputusing Distance-Vector algorithm.
